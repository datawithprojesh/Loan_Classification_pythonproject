# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Project Description
Analyzing loan data to predict eligibility using data cleaning, exploration, and machine learning techniques.

## Purpose
This project is focused on processing loan-related data to predict loan eligibility. The aim is to create a predictive model that can assess whether a loan application should be approved based on various factors.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes various attributes related to loan applications. We perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for modeling.

## Goals
- To preprocess loan data for predictive modeling.
- To identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
- To develop a machine learning model that predicts loan eligibility.

## Achievements
- Successfully loaded and preprocessed the loan dataset.
- Conducted initial exploratory data analysis.
- Began addressing missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to perform data cleaning and modeling.
